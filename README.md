#Advent Of Code 2019

These are my solutions to the 2019 Advent Of Code challenges found [here](https://adventofcode.com)

I am solving these problems in my favorite language, Kotlin.

The easiest way to run my solutions, is to install the commandline Kotlin compiler, instructions are on kotlinlang.org, [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)

If you have the CLI compiler installed, and just need a refresher on how to use it(like I usually do), here you go

To simply compile the solution into a self-contained .jar file, simply run

```kotlinc CalculateFuel.kt -include-runtime -d calculateFuel.jar```

and then run that jar with java

```java -jar calculateFuel.jar```
